# TODO
- bring rustup installer into source, maybe vendor rust?
- keybed firmware
    - increase velocity measurement accuracy
    - send keystrokes + velocity out the serial port
- requires pi 4
    - configure base buildroot image for pi 
        - question: full custom userspace or no?
        - maybe no systemd this time. Keep the image tiny
        - readonly rootfs
    - build vcvrack or cardinal in 
    - test macos m1 vcv rack plugins (newer pi == hopefully closer instruction sets)
        - if they don't work, get a set of plugins to be bundled
    - get usb-hid working
        - https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=341244
    - get OLED working
        - https://www.adafruit.com/product/3531
    - expose block storage over usb when in "instrument" mode to upload patches
    - expose midi when in "midi" mode
    - Maybe also expose a "flashing" mode?
    - OLED screen should be able to switch between internal synth and midi
    - Do we have enough I/O to connect volume/pitch and buttons to the pi?
    - pi should check which firmware the arduino is running, and flash the current version if needed
- Janko conversion
    - replicate key mechanism in cad
    - build janko keys on top
    - 3d print
- Stretch goals
  - Build a custom board for CM4+arduino?
