# TODO
- bring rustup installer into source, maybe vendor rust?
- keybed firmware
  - increase velocity measurement accuracy
  - send keystrokes + velocity out the serial port
- synth host:
  - Load bcm audio module on boot
  - systemd, or another init?
  - Cardinal doesn't support loading patches from cmdline
    - Run cardinal as a daemon, load patches with OSC client?
  - get usb-hid working
    - https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=341244
  - get OLED working
    - https://www.adafruit.com/product/3531
  - expose block storage over usb when in "instrument" mode to upload patches
  - expose midi when in "midi" mode
  - Maybe also expose a "flashing" mode?
  - OLED screen should be able to switch between internal synth and midi
  - Do we have enough I/O to connect volume/pitch and buttons to the pi?
  - pi should check which firmware the arduino is running, and flash the current version if needed
- Janko conversion
  - replicate key mechanism in cad
  - build janko keys on top
  - 3d print
- Stretch goals
  - Build a custom board for CM4+arduino?
